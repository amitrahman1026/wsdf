Be aware of possible incoming changes to the plugin API

    There is [discussion](https://lists.wireshark.org/archives/wireshark-dev/202312/msg00000.html)
    on the wireshark-dev mailing list about changes to the plugin API. This has
    been in the works for a while, and got reverted once. But it is likely to
    happen in the future. Ideally maintainers should keep an eye on this.
    Interesting thread to follow as [well.](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/merge_requests/13747)

Create integration testing for wsdf generated plugins

    As of now, besides unit tests, theres not an end to end testing framework
    that will give a better outlook on parity of wsdf generated plugins and 
    wireshark native plugin functionality.

    A good approach would be to hook onto the test suite of wireshark which uses
    tshark to run against sample pcap files for integration testing.


Improve cross platform building and pin releases to wireshark versions

    Portability options have been provided for macOS solving some users reported
    issues. However it would be great to explore using cargo to handle this. 

    On top of that, there should be a better way to decouple and allow for
    flexibility of the underlying wireshark system. Currently beyond the gitsubmodule
    commit, there is not a more robust pinned version of wireshark.

    It may be worthwhile to explore extending the build.rs or cargo xtasks for 
    more rigid portability

    Windows remain untested.


Add logs to generated code

    Currently, the generated code does not log anything. This makes it hard to
    file bug reports and try to reproduce stuff.

    We could use the `log` crate, but then we'd have to re-export both `log`
    and something like `env_logger` from `wsdf`, so that the generated code can
    call `wsdf::log::info!` etc.

Handle all panics

    The generated code panics in some places. These panics occur when an
    invariant we expect is violated, and crash Wireshark when it happens.

    An alternative is to use Wireshark's "Expert Item" fields, and just
    highlight the error in Wireshark's UI instead of panicking.

More flexible decoding for enums

    Currently, enums must be "dispatched" based on the value of a previous
    field. However, a user may wish to do this:

    struct Order {
        side: Side, // technically a u8
        price: i32,
        quantity: u64,
    }

    #[repr(u8)]
    enum Side {
        Bid,
        Ask,
        Unknown,
    }

    Suppose we implement From<u8> for Side. Maybe we can come up with some way
    to support the above kind of syntax?

Support Wireshark flag types

    This is pretty important, but we'll need to investigate a good syntax for
    it. In the current sample DNS dissector, we technically have a field which
    is to be interpreted as flags, but we're currently just displaying it as a
    regular integer.

    In https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChDissectAdd.html there
    is some information on using Wireshark flags.

Support "virtual" fields

    These are fields which do not change the offset. Something like this

    struct Foo {
        #[wsdf(virtual)]
        y: u8,
        xs: [u8; 10],
    }

    would mean that y is the first byte, but xs is the first ten bytes. I.e. y
    did not increment the offset by one byte.

    We may also consider using Wireshark's `proto_item_set_generated` function
    to mark the field as generated in the UI (it just adds square brackets).

Add some quality of life shorthand attributes

    Currently, to set an integer field to big endian, we need to do

    #[wsdf(enc = "ENC_LITTLE_ENDIAN")]

    which is quite verbose. We could consider having something like

    #[wsdf(le)]

    to mark a field as little endian. Some ideas are:

    - le/be: endianness
    - ascii: mark the field as an FT_STRING type
    - trim: automatically trim white space or null bytes before displaying

Emit code for trait impl even if errors occur

    This helps to reduce error spam. Currently, if something goes wrong during
    compilation, we'll get the actual error and most likely a lot of
    "ProtocolField is not implemented for ..." messages.

    This is because the generated code just contains errors. Instead, we could
    consider generating dummy implementations for the traits too. Something
    like:

    // errors for the compiler to report generated as usual
    // below, we also emit code for the trait impl
    impl ProtocolField for _ {
        fn dissect() { unimplemented!() }
        // and so on...
    }

Collect more errors before giving up

    Currently, our proc macro bails upon the first error it sees. So if we have
    20 errors, we'd need to compile the code 20 times to see them.

    An alternative is to use some kind of context struct, passed around to all
    our functions, which holds a list of all errors encountered. That way, we
    can report as many errors as possible in one go.

Check attributes validity

    Currently, we don't have an explicit step in the codegen process which
    checks each field/variant/type for whether the attributes used are
    completely valid. For example, currently we can have nonsensical things
    like

    #[wsdf(len_field = "x")]
    x: u8,

    because the len_field attribute is just ignored (since it does not apply to
    u8 types). We should add an explicit step where all this stuff is checked.

Use a Serde-like approach

    Currently, we only use the ProtocolField trait for user defined types.
    But what if we implemented it for u8, u16, etc.?

    Then we could get rid of huge parts of the internal data model. When we see
    a field, we don't care what its type is. We just set up some parameters and
    call its dissect method.

    This would be a somewhat large, experimental change.

Use the "smoke-test" thing in build.rs

    See https://github.com/rust-lang/libz-sys/blob/main/src/smoke.c and how
    they use it in their build.rs.

    Basically there may be funky situations where the libwireshark and its
    headers are installed on the system but pkg config cannot find it. In that
    case, we have a smoke.c file pulling in the headers we want. If that
    compiles, that means the headers and dynamic library can be resolved
    somehow. We don't need to clone down the whole wireshark repo in that case.

Improve CI

    Currently, we call Wireshark's debian setup script each time to set up some
    system deps. Obviously in ci we don't need wireshark or tshark. So we
    should prune the useless ones (e.g. alot of QT dependencies!)

    This step is not too slow though, so it is not that important.
